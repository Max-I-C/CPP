# CPP

This project is a collection of small exercises designed as an introduction to C++.

At 42, we learn C++ through these modules. They are designed to introduce a wide range of concepts, each one focusing on different aspects of the language.

Each module has its own Makefile.

## All modules

| Format            | Value associated |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| CPP00 | Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuf |
| CPP01 | Memory allocation, pointers to members, references and switch statements |
| CPP02 | Ad-hoc polymorphism operator overloading and the Orthodox Canonical class form |
| CPP03 | Inheritance |
| CPP04 | Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces |
| CPP05 | Repetition and Exceptions |
| CPP06 | C++ casts |
| CPP07 | C++ templates |
| CPP08 | Templated containers, iterators, algorithms |
| CPP09 | STL |
